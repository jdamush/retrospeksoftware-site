    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Effective date: <strong>YYYY-MM-DD</strong></p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>YOUR COMPANY NAME</strong> (“we”, “us”) handles information when you use the
      <strong>RetroSpek</strong> mobile application (the “App”).
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>Information you provide</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Support communications:</strong> If you email support, we receive the information you send (such as your email address and message content).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Information processed on your device</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Camera / Photos / Microphone (as applicable):</strong> The App may request access to your device camera, microphone, and photo library to record and save video. Media is processed on-device unless you explicitly share it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Purchases and subscriptions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>In-app purchases:</strong> Purchases are processed by Apple. We do not receive your full payment details.</li>
      <li><strong>Purchase metadata:</strong> Apple may provide us limited information to validate entitlements (e.g., subscription status).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Analytics and crash data (choose one)</h3>
    <p><em>Option A (if you do NOT use analytics/crash reporting):</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li>We do not collect analytics or crash logs outside of what Apple provides in aggregate via App Store tools.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Option B (if you DO use analytics/crash reporting like Firebase/TelemetryDeck/Sentry):</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li>We may collect app performance and crash information (such as device type, OS version, app version, and event timestamps) to improve reliability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide and improve the App</li>
      <li>Respond to support requests</li>
      <li>Maintain security and prevent abuse</li>
      <li>Validate subscription access</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell your personal information. We only share information:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>With service providers you enable by your use (e.g., analytics/crash tools, if used)</li>
      <li>When required by law or to protect rights and safety</li>
      <li>To process subscriptions via Apple’s in-app purchase system</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      Support emails are retained as long as needed to address your request and maintain records. If analytics/crash reporting is used,
      data is retained according to the provider’s settings and policies.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You can deny Camera/Photos/Microphone permissions in iOS Settings (some features may not work).</li>
      <li>You can manage subscriptions in your Apple ID subscription settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>
      The App is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
